🚫 **Canceling Requests in React & React Native: The Missing Piece in Your App's Performance Puzzle**

You might be leaking performance _and_ confusing your users — without even realizing it. 😬

In modern, fast-paced UIs, **canceling async requests** isn’t optional — it’s essential.

### 🔍 Real-world scenarios:

- User navigates away before a request finishes
- Same button gets clicked multiple times
- Tab switches trigger multiple background requests

**The result?**

- Memory leaks
- Outdated data
- Sluggish UX
- Extra battery/data usage (especially in React Native)

💡 **The fix?**  
Request cancellation done right.

In my latest guide, I break down exactly how to implement request cancellation using:

✅ Axios  
✅ Fetch + AbortController  
✅ React Query  
✅ RTK Query  
✅ React Native best practices
